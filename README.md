## Architecture

This marketplace uses an **automated sync workflow** to maintain skills from individual source repositories. Each skill is maintained in its own repository and synced to this marketplace via GitHub Actions.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single source of truth - each skill in its own repository
- ✅ Independent development and testing
- ✅ Automated version tracking with semantic versioning + commit dates
- ✅ Scheduled and on-demand synchronization
- ✅ Consistent marketplace structure

**Sync Workflow:**
1. Skills are developed and versioned in separate repositories
2. GitHub Actions sync workflow clones each skill repository
3. Semantic version is extracted from skill's `SKILL.md`
4. Last commit date is appended to create final version (e.g., `1.2.3-20251021`)
5. Skills are copied to `skills/` directory
6. Marketplace metadata is updated with current versions

**Source Repositories:**
- [typo3-docs-skill](https://github.com/netresearch/typo3-docs-skill)
- [typo3-testing-skill](https://github.com/netresearch/typo3-testing-skill)
